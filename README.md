## Design Guidelines

Our official design guidelines for website, marketing and app (UX) is made by [Daniel Kyle](https://github.com/Danielogenna):

## Technologies and Protocols

Ariton builds on [decentralized identifiers](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) (DID), [verifiable credentials](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) (VC), [decentralized web nodes](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes/) (DWN) by [TBD](https://www.tbd.website/), [Codex](https://blog.codex.storage/decentralised-storage-for-virtual-self-sovereign-territories/) by [Institute of Free Technology](https://free.technology/) (under consideration, might be too dependent on blockchain), [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) (Bitcoin federation for privacy and community trading), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) (communication relay protocol and technology).

## Inspiration

The Bitcoin whitepaper references [b-money.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) written by Wei Dai, which contains the following phrase:

```txt
It's a community where the threat of violence is
impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible
because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical
locations.
```

Your Ariton identities is your own, it is not linked or connected to your existing birthname or identity used in real life. You can be yourself, how you want to be.

## Funding
