## Ariton - Join the new economy of the future.

Ariton is a re-envisioning of the economy for human societies that builds on a new foundation of modern solutions that helps elevate the participants into a better tomorrow.

While Bitcoin gave us sound money, a human society needs so much more. Ariton is a (planned) superapp that integrates the latest in decentralized technologies and protocols, allowing anyone to launch their own communities, privately or publicly.

These communities will bring together people, allowing a more free expression and digital lifestyle that is traditionally prohibited on the Internet today.

Ariton is decentralized in such a manner that makes it hardware to be stopped, and is easy for the general audience to contribute with strengthening the network as a whole.

Ariton makes the participants in the communities, owner of their own digital data and online presence. Instead of your personal data being used to monetize you, you own and control your own data and how it is shared with others.

## Inspiration

The Bitcoin whitepaper references [b-money.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) written by Wei Dai, which contains the following phrase:

```txt
I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities
traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the
government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and
permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is
impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible
because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical
locations.
```

## Who wants to use Ariton?

Anyone who want to establish a community that involves around ownership of data and commercial trade within their communities.

## Technologies and Protocols

Ariton builds on [decentralized identifiers](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) (DID), [verifiable credentials](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials) (VC), [decentralized web nodes](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes/) (DWN), [Codex](https://blog.codex.storage/decentralised-storage-for-virtual-self-sovereign-territories/) (under consideration, might be too dependent on blockchain), [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) (Bitcoin federation for privacy and community trading), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) (communication relay protocol and technology).

## Funding

Ariton is seeking investements and funding to continue the development of the new superapp. Behind the project is individuals who have a track record of delivering, wealth of knowledge and experience.
