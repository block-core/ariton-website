                Hi, I am Sondre. Some of you know me, many of you probably don't. 
                I'm inviting you to join me on a journey to build a new kind of app. 
            </p>
                  <p>
              The digital world today is dominated by a few large companies that control the flow of information.
              We believe that the future of the internet is decentralized, where users own their own data and identities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that the world revolves around communities. People come together and form communities of all 
              shapes and kinds, both online and offline. We want to build a platform that empowers these communities to grow 
              and thrive by utilizing the latest in decentralized technologies and open standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ariton is a company that will develop a superapp for communities, under the same name. 
              Ariton is digital company, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), that exists only on the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are looking for funding to continue the development of the superapp for the next two years.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are doing a stock sale to raise between <strong>10 and 30 Bitcoin</strong>.
