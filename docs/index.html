                Discover, create, and join communities that match your interests and passions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ariton is a (future) superapp that lets you create and join communities of any kind, 
                based on your hobbies, ideas, philosophy, faith or anything else. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Built on free and open standards, Ariton gives you the power and ownership of 
                your own identities and data.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ariton brings your real life communities into the digital world, by giving you 
                access to a rich set of features that covers the needs to run complete communities.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ariton is not just another app that collects your data, but a tool to help grow 
                your communities and adopt decentralized technologies that empowers the community, 
                and its users.
            </p>


            <h2>Economy of Communities</h2>

            <p></p>Ariton is a re-envisioning of the economy for human societies that builds on a new foundation of modern solutions that helps elevate the participants into a better tomorrow.</p>

            <p>While Bitcoin gave us sound money, a human society needs so much more. Ariton is a (future) superapp that integrates the latest in decentralized technologies and protocols, allowing anyone to launch their own communities, privately or publicly.</p>

            <p>These communities will bring together people, allowing a more free expression and digital lifestyle that is traditionally prohibited on the Internet today.</p>

            <p>Ariton is decentralized in such a manner that makes it hard to be stopped, and is easy for the general audience to contribute with strengthening the network as a whole.</p>

            <p>Ariton makes the participants in the communities, owner of their own digital data and online presence. Instead of your personal data being used to monetize you, you own and control your own data and how it is shared with others.</p>

<h2>Communities</h2>


<p>
Ariton revolves around communities. You can create and join communities of many kinds, for example "The Knitting Group", which could have instructors, educators, hints and tips, buy and sell and more within the community.
</p>

<p>
A community has no boundries, but can be local and regional, or global and universal.
</p>

<p>
Community owners can earn income from their communities. As a community grows and the quality of content and contributors within it is able to sell their goods and services, the community owners can decide if they want to have a community fee added to various features within the community. This is a way for community manager to reap some rewards from curating a great community.
</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>
    Ariton is seeking investements and funding to continue the development of the new superapp. Behind the project is individuals who have a track record of delivering, wealth of knowledge and experience with software and app development.
