              Built on free and open standards, Ariton gives you the power and <strong>ownership of your own identities and data</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Ariton is not just another app that collects your data, but a tool to help <strong>grow your communities</strong> and adopt
              decentralized technologies that empower the community and its users, both online and offline.</p>
    

          </div>
        </div>

               <h2 class="section-title">Communities</h2>
        <p>Ariton revolves around communities. You can create and join communities of many kinds, for example "The
          Knitting Group", which could have instructors, educators, hints and tips, buy and sell and more within the
          community.</p>
        <p>A community has no boundaries, but can be local and regional, or global and universal.</p>
        <p>Community owners can <strong>earn income from their communities</strong>. As a community grows and the quality of content and
          contributors within it is able to sell their goods and services, the community owners can decide if they want
          to
          have a community fee added to various features within the community. This is a way for community manager to
          reap
          some rewards from curating a great community.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Economy of Communities</h2>
        <p>Ariton is a re-envisioning of the <strong>economy for human societies</strong> that builds on a new foundation of modern
          solutions that help elevate the participants into a better tomorrow.</p>
        <p>While Bitcoin gave us sound money, a human society needs so much more. Ariton is a (future) superapp that
          integrates the latest in decentralized technologies and protocols, allowing anyone to launch their own
          communities, privately or publicly.</p>
        <p>These communities will <strong>bring together people</strong>, allowing a more free expression and digital lifestyle that is
          traditionally prohibited on the Internet today.</p>
        <p>Ariton is decentralized in such a manner that makes it hard to be stopped, and is easy for the general
          audience
          to contribute with strengthening the network as a whole.</p>
        <p>Ariton makes the participants in the communities, owner of their own digital data and online presence.
          Instead
          of your personal data being used to monetize you, <strong>you own and control your own data</strong> and how it is shared with
          others.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">How to think about Ariton?</h2>
        <p>Think of Ariton as a digitalization of your local (and global) communities. Where you communicate privately
          with your friends and community, without any third parties listening on your conversations. How you can
          exchange
          goods and services with your friends and community, without third parties being involved. This is Ariton.</p>
        <p>
          Ariton is a so-called SuperApp, which means it's a platform that offers a wide range of services through
          mini-apps,
          which are different for each community. A community can tailor which mini-apps are accessible for its members.

              focus greatly on
              delivering some of the best user experience available in this space. Ariton runs perfectly in your browser
              on

              image.
              Ariton supports multiple identity providers that build on the open standard for decentralized identifiers

              <p>Ariton replicates reputation in a similar manner as the real world. This means that Ariton attempts to

                payment.

              </p>
              <p>One of the mini-apps that will be built for Ariton, is a decentralized task app. What decentralized in
                the context of Ariton

                There are always a copy of the tasks on the user device, and the tasks are shared with other users in
                the community. Having a tasks
