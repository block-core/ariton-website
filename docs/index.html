      <p>
        Built on free and open standards, Ariton gives you the power and ownership of 
        your own identities and data.
    </p>
      <p> 
          Ariton is not just another app that collects your data, but a tool to help grow 
          your communities and adopt decentralized technologies that empowers the community, 
          and its users.
      </p>


<h2>Communities</h2>


<p>
Ariton revolves around communities. You can create and join communities of many kinds, for example "The Knitting Group", which could have instructors, educators, hints and tips, buy and sell and more within the community.
</p>

<p>
A community has no boundries, but can be local and regional, or global and universal.
</p>

<p>
Community owners can earn income from their communities. As a community grows and the quality of content and contributors within it is able to sell their goods and services, the community owners can decide if they want to have a community fee added to various features within the community. This is a way for community manager to reap some rewards from curating a great community.
</p>

<h2>Economy of Communities</h2>

<p></p>Ariton is a re-envisioning of the economy for human societies that builds on a new foundation of modern solutions that helps elevate the participants into a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin gave us sound money, a human society needs so much more. Ariton is a (future) superapp that integrates the latest in decentralized technologies and protocols, allowing anyone to launch their own communities, privately or publicly.</p>

<p>These communities will bring together people, allowing a more free expression and digital lifestyle that is traditionally prohibited on the Internet today.</p>

<p>Ariton is decentralized in such a manner that makes it hard to be stopped, and is easy for the general audience to contribute with strengthening the network as a whole.</p>

<p>Ariton makes the participants in the communities, owner of their own digital data and online presence. Instead of your personal data being used to monetize you, you own and control your own data and how it is shared with others.</p>


<h2>How to think about Ariton?</h2>

<p>
Think of Ariton as a digitalization of your local (and global) communities. Where you communicate privately with your friends and community, without any third parties listening on your conversations. How you can exchange goods and services with your friends and community, without third parties being involved. This is Ariton.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Identity</h3>

<p>Anyone can make any number of identifiers and build their identity around that identifier. Users can self-determine what metadata they want to share connected to their identifier, such as name and profile image. Ariton supports multiple identity providers that builds on the open standard for decentralized identifiers (DID).</p>

<h3>Marketplace</h3>

<p>Within each community there are marketplaces that allows users to post their offers for sale of goods and services. Purchase of digital assets, such as tickets, can be saved into the users personal data storage (DWN) for safe-keeping.</p>

<h3>Registries</h3>

<p>Anyone can provide "Registry as a Service" within a community, which are curated lists of data. Examples for this are Land Registry and Business Registry.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>Anyone can provide "Verification as a Service" within a community, which is a provider that verifies the authenticity of data (verifiable credentials) or identities (DID). These verification services can issue identity cards to users based upon a set of rules the verification provider decides.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>Anyone can provide "Data as a Service" within a community, which can be any type of data, but one specific data provider would be approved lists of content for children.</p>

<p>A data provider could have different curated lists of approved content, that are tagged with metadata and age-related tagging, allowing parents to subscribe (free or paid service) to data providers and utilize those data lists in apps for children.</p>

<p>Other examples on data, could be a curated list of anarchy communities, or network states, or free cities.</p>

<h3>Reputation</h3>

<p>Reputations are important in the digital world, as a means to filter out noise and problematic actors. Within a community on Ariton, individuals will build up reputations connected to their identifiers.</p>

<p>Ariton replicates reputation in a similar manner as the real world. This means that Ariton attempts to mitigate problems that occurs with gaining influence by purchasing votes, likes and followers with monetary payment. Reputations on Ariton is not a global, it is connected to the community and your connections.</p>

<h2>Who will build Ariton?</h2>

  <p>
Without the advances in open standards on decentralized identifiers, Ariton wouldn't be possible. Launching Ariton comes at the exact time when foundations are laid to develop such an superapp.

<h2>How are we building Ariton?</h2>

<p>Building Ariton was impossible last year. Ariton has been made possible by advances in open standards such as DID, VC and DWNs. It has been made possible with advances in LLM (Large Language Models) and AI. New capabilities for software developers is made available each month and Ariton developers is dedicated to fully adopt the tools and technologies available, to ensure rapid development cycle and very short time to market for new features.</p>

<h2>Technologies and Protocols</h2>

<p>Ariton builds on <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID), <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> (VC), <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes/">decentralized web nodes</a> (DWN) by <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a>, <a href="https://blog.codex.storage/decentralised-storage-for-virtual-self-sovereign-territories/">Codex</a> by <a href="https://free.technology/">Institute of Free Technology</a> (under consideration, might be too dependent on blockchain), <a href="https://fedimint.org/">Fedimint</a> (Bitcoin federation for privacy and community trading), <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a> (communication relay protocol and technology).</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
