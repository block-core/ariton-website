    <div id="about" class="content">
      <p>Built on free and open standards, Ariton gives you the power and ownership of your own identities and data.</p>
      <p>Ariton is not just another app that collects your data, but a tool to help grow your communities and adopt
        decentralized technologies that empower the community and its users.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Communities</h2>
      <p>Ariton revolves around communities. You can create and join communities of many kinds, for example "The
        Knitting Group", which could have instructors, educators, hints and tips, buy and sell and more within the
        community.</p>
      <p>A community has no boundaries, but can be local and regional, or global and universal.</p>
      <p>Community owners can earn income from their communities. As a community grows and the quality of content and
        contributors within it is able to sell their goods and services, the community owners can decide if they want to
        have a community fee added to various features within the community. This is a way for community manager to reap
        some rewards from curating a great community.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">Economy of Communities</h2>
      <p>Ariton is a re-envisioning of the economy for human societies that builds on a new foundation of modern
        solutions that help elevate the participants into a better tomorrow.</p>
      <p>While Bitcoin gave us sound money, a human society needs so much more. Ariton is a (future) superapp that
        integrates the latest in decentralized technologies and protocols, allowing anyone to launch their own
        communities, privately or publicly.</p>
      <p>These communities will bring together people, allowing a more free expression and digital lifestyle that is
        traditionally prohibited on the Internet today.</p>
      <p>Ariton is decentralized in such a manner that makes it hard to be stopped, and is easy for the general audience
        to contribute with strengthening the network as a whole.</p>
      <p>Ariton makes the participants in the communities, owner of their own digital data and online presence. Instead
        of your personal data being used to monetize you, you own and control your own data and how it is shared with
        others.</p>
      <h2 class="section-title">How to think about Ariton?</h2>
      <p>Think of Ariton as a digitalization of your local (and global) communities. Where you communicate privately
        with your friends and community, without any third parties listening on your conversations. How you can exchange
        goods and services with your friends and community, without third parties being involved. This is Ariton.</p>
        <p>
          Ariton is a so-called SuperApp, which means it's a platform that offers a wide range of services through mini-apps, 
          which are different for each community. A community can tailor which mini-apps are accessible for its members.
        </p>
      <h2 id="features" class="section-title">Features</h2>
      <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Web &amp; Mobile First</h3>
      <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-img"><img src="assets/mobile-first.png" class="illustration"></div>
        <div class="flex-text">The primary user experience of Ariton is through the web and mobile devices. We will focus greatly on
          delivering some of the best user experience available in this space. Ariton runs perfectly in your browser on
          any device. You don't need to install yet another app to engage with your communities on Ariton.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3 class="subtitle">Identity</h3>

      <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-text">
          Anyone can make any number of identifiers and build their identity around that identifier. Users can
          self-determine what metadata they want to share connected to their identifier, such as name and profile image.
          Ariton supports multiple identity providers that build on the open standard for decentralized identifiers (DID).
        </div>
        <div class="flex-img"><img src="assets/identities.png" class="illustration">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Marketplace</h3>

      <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-img">
        <img src="assets/marketplace.png" class="illustration">
      </div>
      <div class="flex-text">
        Within each community there are marketplaces that allow users to post their offers for sale of goods and
        services. Purchase of digital assets, such as tickets, can be saved into the user's personal data storage (DWN)
        for safekeeping.</div></div>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Registries</h3>
      <p>Anyone can provide "Registry as a Service" within a community, which are curated lists of data. Examples for
        this are Land Registry and Business Registry.</p>
      <p>If you have any kind of business idea, you can register your company within the communities you are a member
        of. These can be any kinds of company, from selling your homemade clothing to a software development company or
        a retail store.</p>
      <p>The Company Registry will in the future have tooling to help company owners issue dividends and perform general
        assembly voting by stock owners.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Verification</h3>
      <p>Anyone can provide "Verification as a Service" within a community, which is a provider that verifies the
        authenticity of data (verifiable credentials) or identities (DID). These verification services can issue
        identity cards to users based upon a set of rules the verification provider decides.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Data</h3>
      <p>Anyone can provide "Data as a Service" within a community, which can be any type of data, but one specific data
        provider would be approved lists of content for children.</p>
      <p>A data provider could have different curated lists of approved content, that are tagged with metadata and
        age-related tagging, allowing parents to subscribe (free or paid service) to data providers and utilize those
        data lists in apps for children.</p>
      <p>Other examples of data could be a curated list of anarchy communities, or network states, or free cities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Reputation</h3>
      <p>Reputations are important in the digital world, as a means to filter out noise and problematic actors. Within a
        community on Ariton, individuals will build up reputations connected to their identifiers.</p>
      <p>Ariton replicates reputation in a similar manner as the real world. This means that Ariton attempts to mitigate
        problems that occur with gaining influence by purchasing votes, likes and followers with monetary payment.
        Reputations on Ariton are not global, they are connected to the community and your connections.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="subtitle">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>AI will play an important role in Ariton, from helping users create content that is aligned with their
        communities and positive in tone, helping to build and curate great communities.</p>
      <p>Ariton builds on the Web Neural Network API (WebNN), which is an open standard that allows models to run safely
        within the web browser. Ariton will utilize locally run SLMs (Small Language Models) that run on your device,
        keeping your privacy intact.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3 class="subtitle">Mini Apps</h3>
        <p><img src="assets/superapp.png" class="illustration">Based on the needs and requests from communities, mini-apps will be developed by the Ariton team or by third parties 
          to cover those feature needs.
        </p>
        <p>One of the mini-apps that will be built for Ariton, is a decentralized task app. What decentralized in the context of Ariton 
          means, is that the tasks are stored in each user device and not dependent on a centralized server or entity.
          There are always a copy of the tasks on the user device, and the tasks are shared with other users in the community. Having a tasks 
          management app is a great way to help build and maintain a community.
        </p>
      </div>
        
      <h2 id="team" class="section-title">Who will build Ariton?</h2>
      <p>Without the advances in open standards on decentralized identifiers, Ariton wouldn't be possible. Launching
        Ariton comes at the exact time when foundations are laid to develop such a superapp.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">How are we building Ariton?</h2>
      <p>Building Ariton was impossible last year. Ariton has been made possible by advances in open standards such as
        DID, VC, and DWNs. It has been made possible with advances in LLM (Large Language Models), SLM (Small Language
        Models) and AI. New capabilities for software developers are made available each month and Ariton developers are
        dedicated to fully adopting the tools and technologies available, to ensure rapid development cycle and very
        short time to market for new features.</p>
