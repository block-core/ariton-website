            <p>
                Hi, I am Sondre. Some of you know me, many of you probably don't. 
                I'm inviting you to join me on a journey to build a new kind of app. 
            </p>
                  <p>
              The digital world today is dominated by a few large companies that control the flow of information.
              We believe that the future of the internet is decentralized, where users own their own data and identities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that the world revolves around communities. People come together and form communities of all 
              shapes and kinds, both online and offline. We are on a mission to build a platform that empowers these communities to grow 
              and thrive by utilizing the latest in decentralized technologies and open standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ariton is a company that is developing a superapp for communities, under the same name. 
              Ariton is digital company, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), that exists only on the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are looking for funding in the form of convertible notes to continue the development of the superapp for the next two years.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are issuing convertible notes with a total value of <strong>8 Bitcoin</strong> ($540,000).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Convertible notes</h2>

        <p>
          We need more capital to accelerate the development of the Ariton. We are doing this in the form of convertible notes, which are 
          short-term loans that convert into equity in the company at a later date or paid back with interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          The convertible notes will convert into stocks in the company at the next funding round, or at the latest in two years. 
          The <strong>interest rate is 5% per year</strong> (based on valuation in USD at the time of issuance of note), and the conversion rate per stock will come at an <strong>25% discount 
          for holders of notes</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Token</h2>

        <p>
          Ariton will in the future have a token, ARI, that will be used for transactions within the platform. Holders of convertibles notes and stocks will be able 
          to <strong>purchase ARI tokens at a discount</strong>. The exact details on the token sale will be decided as 
          we get closer to the launch of the token. The exact details of the discounts will be decided by the share owners, in the general assembly.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Register</h2>
        
        <p>If you are interested in supporting Ariton by lending us capital to receive convertible notes, please fill out this form and we will get back to you as soon as
          possible.</p>
